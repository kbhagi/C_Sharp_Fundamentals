Fundamentals of C# What is C# ? , What is .Net ? 
C# is a programming Language.
.Net is a Framework of libraries that works on Windows like VB.Net

Before C# whe had two languages in C Family. C, C++ Compiler translated C/C++ code in High Level Language into Native code. We had differenct hardwares & different O.S , So when microsoft was designing C# and .Net they came up with this idea of cross-compatibililty
Borrowing from open_source world , Java where compiler compiles into a Bytecode instead of Native code.

Same way, in C# when you write code ,its compiled into a IL Code , Intermediate Language Code. IL code is independent of computer on which it is running. CLR converts IL Code into Native Code . CLR is an application sitting in memory that converts IL Code into Native Code . This process is called Just-in-time compilations or JIT. So you can write your code in C#, you dont need to worry about architecture because CLR takes care of that , CLR is specific to Linux, Windows,Mac OS X. That takes care of conversion into machine code i.e Native Code , & running on that operating system.
